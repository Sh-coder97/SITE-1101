          As <strong>Team 56</strong>, we planned and developed a set of digital logic gates during our coursework at <strong>ADA University</strong>. This project aimed to bridge theoretical knowledge with hands-on practice by transforming abstract concepts into real electronic implementations. We successfully constructed <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>, <strong>NOT</strong>, <strong>NAND</strong>, and <strong>XOR</strong> gates using fundamental electronic components, gaining practical insight into how hardware-level logic operates.

          In <strong>Team 56</strong>, we organized an interactive educational visit to a school, where we conducted a hands-on learning session for students. Throughout the workshop, we introduced and demonstrated algorithms such as <strong>Random</strong>, <strong>Square</strong>, and <strong>Back-and-Forth</strong> using simple, real-life examples. The session was designed to encourage logical reasoning and to help students build early computational thinking skills in an engaging and accessible way.
