      <p>
        My academic and personal interests include
        <strong>Mathematics</strong> and
        <strong>Programming</strong>.
        I am especially interested in the intersection of hardware and software,
        building clean and functional systems, and applying mathematical thinking
        to real-world engineering and data problems.

      <p>
        I actively use Codecademy to strengthen my programming foundations through
        structured, hands-on courses. My learning focuses on building strong
        fundamentals, understanding core concepts deeply, and applying them
        in practice. This continuous learning process helps me improve both my
        technical accuracy and confidence when working on projects.
