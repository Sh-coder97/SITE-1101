        My academic journey focuses on building a strong foundation in key engineering and analytical subjects such as <strong>digital systems</strong>, <strong>circuit analysis</strong>, and <strong>logic design</strong>. In addition to my coursework, I work on practical projects that help me apply what I learn and gradually improve my technical and problem-solving skills.

      <p>
        Since childhood, I've had a keen interest in <strong>books,acting, and music</strong>. My favorite musicians are Chase Atlantic, the Weeknd, and Chris Grey. I also have a talent for acting, and I have a pretty good voice, but I’m unable to develop it because my parents are against me pursuing it as a profession. In the future, I plan to work in the financial sector and also have my own business.

        I use <strong>Codecademy</strong> to improve my programming skills through structured, hands-on courses. My learning focuses on understanding core concepts clearly and applying them in practice. This continuous learning process helps me become more confident and accurate when working on projects.
